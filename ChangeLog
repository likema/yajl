	interface to the parser (eats JSON, poops a memory representation)
     * lloyd require a C99 compiler
     * lloyd integers are now represented with long long (64bit+) on all platforms.
     * lloyd size_t now used throughout to represent buffer lengths, so you can
	safely manage buffers greater than 4GB.
     * gno semantic improvements to yajl's API regarding partial value parsing and
	trailing garbage

1.0.12
     * Conrad Irwin - Parse null bytes correctly
     * Mirek Rusin - fix LLVM warnings
     * gno - Don't generate numbers for keys. closes #13

     * John Stamp - Don't export private symbols.
     * John Stamp - Install yajl_version.h, not the template.
     * John Stamp - Don't use -fPIC for static lib.  Cmake will automatically add it for the shared.
     * lloyd 0 fix paths embedded in dylib upon installation on osx.  closes #11

1.0.11
     * lloyd remove -Wno-missing-field-initializers for greater gcc compat (3.4.6)

	for installation (i.e. lib64) 
     * Vitali Lovich - yajl version number now programatically accessible
     * lloyd - prevent cmake from embedding rpaths in binaries.  Static linking
	makes this unneccesary.

1.0.9
     * lloyd - fix inverted logic causing yajl_gen_double() to always fail on
	win32 (thanks to Fredrik Kihlander for the report) 

1.0.8
     * Randall E. Barker - move dllexport defnitions so dlls with proper
	exports can again be generated on windows 
     * lloyd - add yajl_get_bytes_consumed() which allows the client to
	determine the offset as an error, as well as determine how
	many bytes of an input buffer were consumed.
     * lloyd - fixes to keep "error offset" up to date (like when the
	client callback returns 0)
     * Brian Maher - allow client to specify a printing function in
       generation

1.0.6
     * lloyd fix several compiler warnings

	allocation time

	specify end-of-input, solving the "lonely number" case, where
	json text consists only of an element with no explicit syntactic
	end.
     * tjw many new test cases	
     * tjw cleanup of code for symmetry and ease of reading
     * lloyd integration of patches from Robert Varga which cleanup
	compilation warnings on 64 bit linux

	numbers to client.  Thanks to Hatem Nassrat.
     * lloyd yajl_integer now deals in long, instead of long long.  This
	combined with yajl_number improves compiler compatibility while
	maintaining precision.
     * lloyd better ./configure && make experience (still requires cmake and
	ruby)
     * lloyd fix handling of special characters hex 0F and 1F in yajl_encode
